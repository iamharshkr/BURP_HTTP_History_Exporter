# HTTP History Exporter - Burp Suite Extension

## Overview

The **HTTP History Exporter** is a Burp Suite extension designed to help users export HTTP request and response data from Burp Suiteâ€™s proxy history. The extension allows you to select specific domains, filter the HTTP traffic, and export the data in a structured CSV format. This is especially useful for auditing, analyzing API requests, or exporting traffic for later analysis.

## Features

- **Domain Filtering**: Select specific domains to export based on the captured requests.
- **CSV Export**: Export HTTP history into a well-structured CSV file.
- **Duplicate Removal**: Ensure that only unique URLs are included in the exported file.
- **Customizable UI**: User-friendly graphical interface for interacting with Burp Suite.

## Prerequisites

To use this extension, you need the following:
- **Burp Suite** (Pro or Community Edition)
- Python 2.7.x or 3.x (depends on your environment)
- The Burp Suite Python API available (ensure your environment has the necessary modules)

## Installation

1. **Download the Extension**:
   - Download the `.py` file of the extension or clone the GitHub repository if available.

2. **Install in Burp Suite**:
   - Open Burp Suite.
   - Go to the "Extender" tab.
   - In the "Extensions" sub-tab, click on "Add".
   - Select the `.py` file of the extension and add it to Burp Suite.

3. **Python Dependencies**:
   - Ensure Python and the necessary libraries are installed as required by Burp Suite extensions.

## How to Use

1. **Starting the Extension**:
   - Once the extension is installed, a new tab titled **"HTTP Exporter"** will appear in Burp Suite under the "Extender" tab.
   - Click on the **"HTTP Exporter"** tab to access the extension.

2. **Select Domains**:
   - Click the **"Refresh Domains"** button to load all available domains from the Burp Suite site map.
   - Select the domains whose HTTP history you wish to export by checking the corresponding checkboxes.

3. **Export HTTP History**:
   - After selecting the desired domains, click the **"Export"** button to start the export process.
   - A file dialog will appear allowing you to save the exported data in CSV format.

4. **CSV Output Format**:
   The exported CSV file will contain the following columns:
   - **S.No.**: A serial number for each request.
   - **API**: The request method (e.g., GET, POST) and the requested URL, including the body if available.
   - **Parameters**: Query and body parameters of the request (one per line).



## Configuration Options

### Domains
- **Refresh Domains**: Fetches the list of domains from the Burp Suite site map to filter by.
- **Select Domains**: Choose the domains you want to export traffic for. Multiple domains can be selected.

### Exporting
- **Export to CSV**: Allows the user to save the HTTP history as a CSV file.

## Troubleshooting

- **No HTTP History Found**: If no HTTP traffic is found in the Burp Suite proxy history, ensure that the proxy is actively intercepting requests.
- **No Domains Selected**: Ensure you have selected at least one domain before attempting the export.
- **Error Parsing URL**: If an error occurs while parsing a URL, it might be due to malformed URLs in the history. Check the traffic logs for any irregularities.

## Code Overview

- **BurpExtender**: This class implements the main functionality for the Burp Suite extension, including registering the extension, handling UI components, and exporting HTTP history.
- **UI Components**: The extension provides a graphical interface with checkboxes to select domains and buttons to refresh domains or export the HTTP history.
- **Export Process**: The HTTP history is filtered based on selected domains, and duplicate URLs are removed before exporting the data into a CSV file.
